I would like to first evoke my unending appreciation to Dr. Erich Schneider
for guiding and advising me through out my graduate studies at the University 
of Texas.  Furthermore, I would like to thank the Nuclear \& Radiation Engineering 
program for granting me countless opportunities and support over the years.

Moreover, I am continually indebted to Dr. Jun Li and Dr. Man-Sung Yim for their 
influence, criticisms, and efforts without which much of this work would have been 
severely impoverished.

Additionally, gratitude unbound must be expressed to The Hacker Within.  
At the risk of leaving many worthy friends unacknowledged, a heart-felt 
thanks to Dr. Paul Wilson, Dr. Milad Fatenejad, and Dr. Puneet Kishor 
for challenging me to be a better scientist and engineer.  To Kathryn Huff, words fail.

For their unwavering support and understanding, the company Enthought
deserves great praise for helping me persevere through the course of my studies.
In specific, the resolutions of Dr. Travis Oliphant and Jonathan March cannot go unrecognized.

Nuclear fuel cycles (NFC) are the collection of interconnected processes which
generate electricity through nuclear power.  Due to the high degree of 
coupling between components even in the simplest cycles, the need for a dynamic 
fuel cycle simulator and analysis framework arises.  The work presented herein develops 
essential physics models of nuclear power reactors and incorporate them into a NFC 
simulation framework.  

First, a one-energy group reactor model is demonstrated.   
This essential physics model is then to simulate a sampling fuel cycles which are perturbations of
well known base-case cycles.  Because the NFC may now be simulated quickly, stochastically
modeling many fuel cycle realizations dramatically  expands the parameter space which may be analyzed. 
Finally, a multigroup reactor model which incorporates spectral changes as a function of burnup
is presented to increase the fidelity of the original one-group reactor.

These methods form a suite of modeling technologies which reach from the lowest levels
(individual components) to the highest (inter-cycle comparisons).
Prior to the development of this model suite, such broad-ranging analysis had been unrealistic to perform.
The work here thus presents a new, multi-scale approach to fuel cycle system design.

Anthony Michael Scopatz was born in Three Rivers, Califonia.  Anthony's childhood was spent
growing up in Simi Valley, California, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Morgan
Hill, California.  Anthony then embarked on a Bachelor of Science in Physics at
the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2002. Upon successful completion in 2006, 
graduate studies commenced at the University of Texas at Austin in the Nuclear and
Radiation Engineering Program in the Mechanical Engineering Department.
Anthony currently resides in Austin and wishes to escape Civilization for
