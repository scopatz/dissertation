\section{Multigroup Cross Section Generatrion}
\index{Multigroup Cross Section Generatrion@\emph{Multigroup Cross Section Generatrion}}
When seeking to parameterize nuclear power reactors as a function of initial conditions, 
the set of possible indpendent parameters quickly becomes large. In addition to geometric 
design considerations, the fuel characteristics of the reactor must also be accounted for.

In the one-energy-group reactor model (R1G), the initial loading was paramterized based
on neutron production rates, neutron destruction rates, and transmutation matricies per
nuclide \cite{Scopatz2009d}.  All of these metrics are a function of flunece.  (Under 
constant irradiation, fluence is a clear surrogate for time.)

A $G$-energy-group reactor model (RMG) seeks to re-paramterize the one-group formulation 
in terms of energy.  While the multi-group formulation will remain on a per nuclide basis, 
the neutron reaction rates do not have have a meaningful per unit energy expression that 
is independent of the flux.  Moreover changing reaction rates also invalidate the 
transmutation matricies.  

Therefore, the RMG, in a level of sophistication above the R1G, must be able to calculate
the multigroup flux.  To do so requires multigroup microscopic neutron cross-sections.  
Using the cross-sections as independent reactor parameters in a multigroup sense is 
effectively equivelent to removing the flux from the reaction rates in the one-group case.
This is seen in Equation \ref{reaction_rate_calc}
\begin{equation}
\label{reaction_rate_calc}
R = \sigma \cdot \phi \cdot 10^{-24}
\end{equation}
where $R$ [hz] is the reaction rate, $\sigma$ [barns] is the one-group cross section, and
$\phi$ [n/cm\superscript{2}/s] is the energy-integrated flux.

The remainder of this section is deliniated into a discussion on notation, how initial 
reactor conditions are specified, the three methods that were used to compute the
cross sections, and te.

\subsection{Notation}
\index{Notation@\emph{Notation}}
The group constants $\sigma_{itg}$ are themselves parameterized by nuclide, time, and 
incident neutron energy.  Nuclides are indexed by $i$, times are indexed by $t$, and 
energy is indexed by $g$ with the lower indices representing higher energy groups.

To fully describe a reactor, several neutron reation types are required.  The type 
also augments the group constant notation by being a comma-separated preposition to 
the index.  For example, the total cross section would be represented by the symbol 
$\sigma_{t,itg}$. Table \ref{reaction_type_table} displays the reactions used in this 
study, their symbolic abbreviations, and the cooresponding MT number coming from ENDF 
specification \cite{MFMT}.  Entries whose MT number is given as a $\dagger$ indicates 
that the generation of these tallies was performed in a special way (see below).
Additionally, the group-to-group scattering cross section is denoted by the symbol
$\sigma_{s,itgh}$ where $g$ denotes the incident neutron energy (as before) and $h$
gives the exiting neutron energy.

\subsection{Parameterization of Initial Conditions}
\index{Parameterization of Initial Conditions@\emph{Parameterization of Initial Conditions}}
The multigroup reactor model requires a library of pre-computed group constants which it uses
to calculate run-time cross section values for the core.  This library must therefore satisfy 
two conditions.  The first is that it contain group constant information for all independent, 
mutable parameters of interest.  The second is that the values of these variables must span 
their cooresponding range of interest.  

Changes in the inital parameter conditions would then elicit changes in the cross section 
values. Differences in the group contants would thus be picked up by the RMG.  For example, 
take the case of neutron self-shielding in a material with a strong resonance aborption peak.  
As the number denisty of the absorober increases, the group constant in the spectrum around 
the peak may plument because the flux bottoms out.  In a relatively dilute medium, the group 
constant and the flux would increase because fewer neutrons (in an absolute sense) are destroyed 
in this regime.  That the  cross section library captures such effects is the primary advantage 
of a multigroup model over the traditional one-group method.

The code which produces the cross section library is known as CHAR (CITEME).  Char currently
has the ability to adjust a reactor template based on many inital parameters.  These fall
conceptually into three categories: geometric properties, material properties, and time.
Table \ref{char_perturbable_variables} lists the parameters that define a \emph{perturbation}
in char.

Every parameter is specified with one or more values.  The outer product of all parameter
values defines the set of perturbations for which the group constants are calculated.
The total number of perturbations, $n_{\mbox{pert}}$, is therefore given by the product of 
the lengths of the parameter arrays.  \emph{In concreto}, Table \ref{char_param_outer_product} 
displays the perturbtaions when the fuel density has two values, the initial \nuc{U}{235} mass 
fraction also takes two values, and the group constants are calculated at three burn steps.

While Table \ref{char_param_outer_product} represents a simple set of reactors, this formulation 
allows for the easy expansion and extention of input parameters, and thus new pertubations. 
Including additional values for any parameter would extend the number of rows in the table.  
Including other parameters, such as initial \nuc{U}{236} concentration, would expand the number of
columns in the perturbation table, effectively increasing the dimensionality parameterized.
A particularly aggresive strategy would be to include the mass fractions of all actinides initially
present in the core.  In a recycle senario, this would increase the number of parameters by 
appoxrimately an order of magnitude.  

For the remainder of the this study the perturbations presented in Table \ref{char_param_outer_product}
were sufficient to demonstrate the validity of the multigroup method.

\subsection{Cross Section Generation: Serpent}
\index{Cross Section Generation: Serpent@\emph{Cross Section Generation: Serpent}}
Of the over 3000 nuclides, continuous cross section information is available for only 
approximately 400 major species.  Moreover, not all reactions are tallied 
for these nuclides.  However, where fundemental cross section data exists for a nuclide
and a reaction, it is preferable to use this high-fidelity information to compute group
constants over other methods discussed below.

$G$-group cross sections are assembled for each pertubation using the Monte Carlo neutron
transport code Serpent \cite{Lepp2011}.  Char fills a templated Serpent input deck with the
perturbation values and then executes the transport code.  The templates use a combination 
of detectors in the fuel, cladding, and coolant regions as well as the universe metrics that 
Serpent outputs to determine the group constants.

In almost every case, the detectors specified with the appropriate MT number suffice.  
However, some tallies (and some reaction-like parameters) are not given by detectors
but are still computable via Serpent.

Foremost of the non-standard calculations is the group-to-group scattering cross section
$\sigma_{s,itgh}$.  Among the region-based output of Seperpent are both a group transfer
probability matrix $P_{gh}$ as well as the group-to-group scattering cross section
as calculated via the constraints in equations \ref{gtg_constraint} \& \ref{gtg_calc}.
\begin{equation}
\label{gtg_constraint}
\sum_h^G P_{gh} = 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{gtg_calc}
\sigma_{s,gh} = P_{gh} \cdot \sigma_{s,g}
\end{equation}
However, the group transfer probability, and thus the group-to-group scattering cross sections
are functions of the entire region and not individual species within that region.  

Unfortunately, the RMG itself requires that the group-to-group scattering cross sections be provided 
per nuclide. To this end, the authors modified the source code of Serpent to include an optional 
additional mode where $P_{gh}$ is calculated for only a specific sub-material in a region.    
Using this mode with a one-nuclide material, equation \ref{gtg_calc}, and the detector calculated
scattering cross section $\sigma_{s,itg}$, the group-to-group scattering cross section could 
be computed for a single species.

The next supplemental calculation that char performs comes more from a defficiency in the 
ENDF specification than from Serpent.  Reactions which leave the final nucleus in an energy
state above ground do not recieve separate MT numbers.  Moreover, some of these excited states
are metastable and may persist long enough in the core to have a significant interaction 
probability of their own.  Additionally, certain metastable nuclides, such as \nuc{Am}{242}\superscript{*},
persist for long enough that they have noticable impacts on the fuel cycle, specifically with regards to 
the repository.  That metastable nuclides have their own contiuous enegy cross section libraries
but can not be generated by the reaction in these libraries is a perrenial issue.

Here the issue is circumvented by using the 64-group cross section library from CINDER that is 
included with MCNPX versions 2.6+ \cite{Pelowitz2008}.  The cinder cross sections include metastable
interactions where available.  Serpent is then used to compute a `high-resolution' 
flux spectrum which matches the group structure of the cinder data for each perturbation.  
Collapsing the metastable and ground cross sections to $G$-groups and dividing the former by 
the later gives a metastable-to-ground ratio $r_{\mbox{meta}}$.  This ratio may then be used along with 
the Seprent tally to calculate the group constants desired, as seen in equations \ref{msground} \& 
\ref{msex}.
\begin{equation}
\label{msground}
\sigma_{\gamma,itg} = \frac{\sigma_{\gamma_{\mbox{tot}},itg}}{1 + r_{\mbox{meta}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{msex}
\sigma_{\gamma*,itg} = r_{\mbox{meta}} \cdot \sigma_{\gamma,itg}
\end{equation}
In equation \ref{msground}, the $\sigma_{\gamma_{\mbox{tot}},itg}$ represents the total neutron
capture cross section.  This is what is provided by the Serpent via MT 102.  However, cinder 
lists the ground and metastable states separately.  For most nuclides that do not have a metastable state, the 
ground state interaction is the total (\emph{i.e.} $\sigma_{\gamma,itg} = \sigma_{\gamma_{\mbox{tot}},itg}$).
The RMG expects the interaction tallies to be split out, as in cinder.  Analogous equations are 
derivable for the (n, 2n) and (n, 2n*) situation.

Furthermore, the average number of neutrons produced per fission event $\bar{\nu}$ is also 
calculated in special way via Serpent.  The psuedo-tally number $-7$ yields $\bar{\nu}\sigma_{f,itg}$.
Using the fission group constant calculated from serpent in the usual way, an expression for $\bar{\nu}$
is trivially obtained (equation \ref{mg_nubar}).
\begin{equation}
\label{mg_nubar}
\bar{\nu}_{itg} = \frac{\bar{\nu}\sigma_{f,itg}}{\sigma_{f,itg}}
\end{equation}

The final psuedo-tally that is calculated via serpent is the fission neutron energy spectrum, $\chi$.
The continious energy cross section data libraries do not contian information on $\chi$.  However, 
Serpent outputs per group values for this parameter for different regions.  While this does not 
capture per nuclide effects, $\chi$ varies only slightly among different species.  
Moreover, since a Serpent run is performed for each perturbation, changes to 
the initial conditions are still encapsulated.  Thus the induced error on the RMG is very low.


\subsection{Cross Section Generation: Physical Models \& CINDER}
\index{Cross Section Generation: Physical Models@\emph{Cross Section Generation: Physical Models}}
As mentioned in the previous section, continuous energy cross section data is available for only 
a small fraction of the nuclides, though arguably the most important ones.  However, some species 
may have signifigcant fuel cycle importance and yet do not have highest-fidelity data available.

In this case, Char and the RMG `fall-back' to using a combination of Cinder data and fundemental 
physical models to estimate the group constants. The first stage in this calculation, as with the 
metastable-to-ground ratio, is to use Serpent to compute a 64-group high-fidelity flux $\phi_n$
which matches the structure used in the Cinder library.  If Cinder data exists for a nuclide for 
a reaction, a simple collapse down to $G$-groups is performed.  For other reactions physical
models are used.  In all cases if Cinder data and physical models are not available, then group
constants of zero are assumed.  Note that group constants tabulated in this way, while dependent 
on changes in the spectrum, are independent of effects such as self-shielding.
The remainder of this section discusses the reactions individually.

First, Cinder includes cross section information for fission reaction.  If a nuclide does not 
contain fission cross section information it is a safe assuption that either the species 
is not fissionable or is an actinide of such high order that it exists in a reactor in vanishingly 
small quantities.  If $n$ indexes $N=64$ groups from Cinder and $E$ denotes the enegry boundaries[MeV], 
the $G$-group collapsed fission cross section may be computed as in equation \ref{fiss_group_collapse}.
\begin{equation}
\label{n_lower}
n_l = \min(n|E_g<E_n)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{n_upper}
n_u = \max(n|E_n<E_{g+1}) - 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{f_lower}
f_l = \frac{E_{n_l} - E_g}{E_{n_l} - E_{n_l-1}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}    
\label{f_upper}
f_u = \frac{E_{g+1} - E_{n_u}}{E_{n_u+1} - E_{n_u}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{fiss_group_collapse}
\sigma_{f,itg} = \frac{f_l\sigma_{f,itn_l-1}\phi_{n_l-1} + \sum_{n=n_l}^{n_u} \sigma_{f,itn}\phi_n + f_l\sigma_{f,itn_u+1}\phi_{n_u+1}}{f_l\phi_{n_l-1} + \sum_{n=n_l}^{n_u} \phi_n  + f_u\phi_{n_u+1}}
\end{equation}
Equations \ref{n_lower}-\ref{f_upper} define lower and upper indices and linear energy fractions
which aid in calculating group constants in which the boundaries only partially overlap.

Cinder does not include $\bar{\nu}$ data and so for nuclides where the fission cross-section is 
non-zero, a constant value of 2.5 was assumed. Cinder also does not include fission neutron 
spectrum information.  Where fission is possible, the physical model seen in equation \ref{chi_model}
was discretized to $G$-groups.
\begin{equation}
\label{chi_model}
\chi(E) = 0.453 \cdot e^{-1.036E} \cdot \sinh\left(\sqrt{2.29E}\right)
\end{equation}
This spectrum comes from \nuc{U}{235}, but may be used for other nuclides as well \cite{Lamarsh2002}.

Non-fission absorption reaction cross sections ($\gamma$, 2n, 3n, $p$, $d$, \nuc{H}{3}, \nuc{He}{3}, 
$\alpha$, $\gamma*$, 2n*) are computed similarlly to the fission group constant.  If a reaction 
type is available in Cinder, a group collapse on the 64-group data is performed.  If the reaction 
type is not present for a nuclide, the interaction is assumed to be impossible and zero values
are returned.

The absorption cross section $\sigma_{a,itg}$ is simply the sum of its constituient elements, as 
computed above.  Set $r_x$ as a non-fission absorption reaction type, then
\begin{equation}
\label{sig_a_model}
\sigma_{a,itg} = \sigma_{f,itg} + \sum_{r_x} \sigma_{r_x,itg}
\end{equation}
Cinder includes several reactions that are not tracked by the RMG or Char, such as (n, 4n). 
However, these interactions are included in the absorprion reaction estimate here.  

Considerably more complicated is the physical model of the scattering cross section.  Unfortunately, 
Cinder provides no pretabulated 64-group data to collapse.  Moreover, the group-to-group scattering
cross section $\sigma_{s,itgh}$ is desired, effectively adding an additional dimension to compute.
Furthermore, because scattering reactions are mainly about energy transfer between the neutron and 
nuclide, the material tempurature $T$ [K] is also important.

Equation \ref{scat_ce} represents a coninuous energy model of the scattering cross section for a free gas
\cite{Yamamoto2006, Mattes2005}.
\begin{equation}
\label{scat_ce}
\sigma_s(E) = 4 \pi b^2 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{2E}{931.46 \cdot m_n}\right) \cdot
              \left(1 + \frac{m_n}{M_A} \frac{kT}{E} \cdot e^{-\frac{M_A}{m_n}\frac{E}{kT}}\right) 
              \cdot \left(1 - \mbox{Exp}\left[-\sqrt{\frac{0.1}{E}}\right]\right)
\end{equation}
where $b$ [cm] is the bound scattering length of the target nucleus, $E$ [MeV] is the incident
neutron energy, $m_n$ is mass of the neutron, $M_A$ is the mass of the target nucleus, and
$k$ [MeV/K] is Boltzmann's constant.

Term by term, $4 \pi b^2$ represents a base estimate of the scattering cross section.  
The $\left(1 - \frac{2E}{931.46 \cdot m_n}\right)$ term is a relativitstic correction
factor for $b$.  The remaining two terms are an adjusted neutron exiting-energy itegrated 
reprentation of the scattering kernel $S(\alpha, \beta)$ for a free gas.

The bound scattering length for a nuclide is computed via coherent and incoherent components
(equation \ref{scat_len}).
\begin{equation}
\label{scat_len}
b = \sqrt{\left| b_{\mbox{coh}} \right|^2 + \left| b_{\mbox{inc}} \right|^2}
\end{equation}
Values for the scattering lengths were obtained from \cite{Sears1992}.  For nuclides
that do not appear in this tabulation, a $b$ of the nuclide of the same element was
used as a surrogate.  If the entire element was absent from the tabulation, then the 
scattering length of the next lowest Z-numbered nuclide was substituted instead.

The group-to-group scattering cross section may thus be caluclated as in equation \ref{scat_collapse}.
\begin{equation}
\label{scat_collapse}
\sigma_{s,gh} = \frac{\int_{E_g}^{E_{g+1}} \int_{E_h}^{E_{h+1}} \sigma_s(E) P(E \to E^\prime) \phi_g(E) dE^\prime dE}
                     {\int_{E_g}^{E_{g+1}} \phi_g(E) dE}
\end{equation}
with $E^\prime$ as the exiting neutron energy and $P(E \to E^\prime)$ being the differential probability of 
scattering from one energy to another.  This probability is computed via equation \ref{P_E_to_E_prime}
\begin{equation}
\label{P_E_to_E_prime}
P(E \to E^\prime) = \frac{1}{E + kT - \left(\frac{M_A - m_n}{M_A + m_n}\right)^2 E}
\end{equation}
Note that equation \ref{P_E_to_E_prime} is only valid on the range 
\begin{equation}
\label{P_E_to_E_prime_range}
\left(\frac{M_A - m_n}{M_A + m_n}\right)^2 E \le E^\prime \le E + kT
\end{equation}
For all values of $E^\prime$ outside of this range, $P(E \to E^\prime) = 0$.

Subjecting the numerically computed the double integral in equation \ref{scat_collapse} 
to the incident scattering constraint yields the appropriate group constant (equation \ref{scat_constraint}).
\begin{equation}
\label{scat_constraint}
\sigma_{s,g} = \sum_h^G \sigma_{s,gh}
\end{equation}

Finally, the total cross section may be expressed a the sume between the absorption and scattering
cross sections, as computed in the models above.
\begin{equation}
\label{tot_xs_model}
\sigma_{t,g} = \sigma_{s,g} + \sigma_{a,g}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cross Section Generation: Interpolation}
\index{Cross Section Generation: Interpolation@\emph{Cross Section Generation: Interpolation}}
The last class of nuclides are those for which there are no continuous energy cross section data 
available and do not have enough of a fuel cycle impact which warrents computing group constants 
via physical models.  Due to the unimportance of these species, only the roughest of estimates
of their cross sections is needed.  Moreover, such estimation may be done at RMG run-time rather 
than durring library generation.

The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) provides simple cross section information
for alomst 3000 nuclides at a variety of energies \cite{KAER2000}.  Specifially, data for
thermal (2.53E-08 [MeV]) and fission spectrum average (taken as 1.0 [MeV]) was used as represetative
thermal and fast cross sections.  Ignoring all other effects (particularly epithermal resonances), 
group constants were computed by lineraly interpolating these two cross sections.  Call 
$\sigma_{r_x}^t$ and $\sigma_{r_x}^f$ the thermal and fast cross sections respectively.  The group
constants for a reaction $r_x$ were estimated using equation \ref{group_const_est}.
\begin{equation}
\label{group_const_est}
\sigma_{r_x,g} = \frac{\sigma_{r_x}^f - \sigma_{r_x}^t}{1 - \mbox{2.53E-08}} \cdot (E_g - \mbox{2.53E-08}) + \sigma_{r_x}^t
\end{equation}
In the case where even this method fails (negative cross sections computed or data not available), 
a zero values is finally assumed for this group constant.
