abstract = {An RDD attack against the U.S. is something America needs to prepare against. If such an event occurs the ability to quickly identify the source of the radiological material used in an RDD would aid investigators in identifying the perpetrators. Spent fuel is one of the most dangerous possible radiological sources for an RDD. In this work, a forensics methodology was developed and implemented to attribute spent fuel to a source reactor. The specific attributes determined are the spent fuel burnup, age from discharge, reactor type, and initial fuel enrichment. It is shown that by analyzing the post-event material, these attributes can be determined with enough accuracy to be useful for investigators. The burnup can be found within a 5\% accuracy, enrichment with a 2\% accuracy, and age with a 10\% accuracy. Reactor type can be determined if specific nuclides are measured. The methodology developed was implemented into a code call NEMASYS. NEMASYS is easy to use and it takes a minimum amount of time to learn its basic functions. It will process data within a few minutes and provide detailed information about the results and conclusions.},

abstract = {Do you want easy access to the latest methods in scientific computing? This greatly expanded third edition of Numerical Recipes has it, with wider coverage than ever before, many new, expanded and updated sections, and two completely new chapters. The executable C++ code, now printed in colour for easy reading, adopts an object-oriented style particularly suited to scientific applications. Co-authored by four leading scientists from academia and industry, Numerical Recipes starts with basic mathematics and computer science and proceeds to complete, working routines. The whole book is presented in the informal, easy-to-read style that made earlier editions so popular. Highlights of the new material include: '¢ A new chapter on classification and inference, Gaussian mixture models, HMMs, hierarchical clustering, and SVMs '¢ A new chapter on computational geometry, covering KD trees, quad- and octrees, Delaunay triangulation, and algorithms for lines, polygons, triangles, and spheres '¢ Interior point methods for linear programming '¢ MCMC '¢ An expanded treatment of ODEs with completely new routines '¢ Many new statistical distributions For more information, or to buy the book, visit www.cambridge.org/numericalrecipes.

abstract = {High-level nuclear waste -- one of the nation's most hazardous substances -- is accumulating at 80 sites in 35 states. The waste is supposed to be disposed of in a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, NV. However, the repository is more than a decade behind schedule, and the nuclear waste generally remains at the commercial nuclear reactor sites and DoE sites where it was generated. This report examines the key attributes, challenges, and costs of the Yucca Mountain repository and the two principal alternatives to a repository that nuclear waste management experts identified: storing the nuclear waste at two centralized locations and continuing to store the waste on site where it was generated.

This greatly expanded third edition of Numerical Recipes has it, with wider coverage than ever before, many new, expanded and updated sections, and two completely new chapters. The executable C++ code, now printed in colour for easy reading, adopts an object-oriented style particularly suited to scientific applications. Co-authored by four leading scientists from academia and industry, Numerical Recipes starts with basic mathematics and computer science and proceeds to complete, working routines. The whole book is presented in the informal, easy-to-read style that made earlier editions so popular. Highlights of the new material include: '¢ A new chapter on classification and inference, Gaussian mixture models, HMMs, hierarchical clustering, and SVMs '¢ A new chapter on computational geometry, covering KD trees, quad- and octrees, Delaunay triangulation, and algorithms for lines, polygons, triangles, and spheres '¢ Interior point methods for linear programming '¢ MCMC '¢ An expanded treatment of ODEs with completely new routines '¢ Many new statistical distributions For more information, or to buy the book, visit www.cambridge.org/numericalrecipes.

Consisting of a collection of algorithms and methods, the LRM describes complex core behavior, but it is simpler than the complex programs developed for design calculations. This makes the LRM particularly useful as a teaching tool to explain the basic principles of nuclear fuel management. The LRM mainly focuses on the pressurized water reactor, but it is also directly applicable to the boiling water reactor. Application of the LRM to the CANDU reactor is also covered.},
