@article{Gonzalez-Garcia2011,
abstract = {The original aim of the Information Theory (IT) was to solve a purely technical problem: to increase the performance of communication systems, which are constantly affected by interferences that diminish the quality of the transmitted information. That is, the theory deals only with the problem of transmitting with the maximal precision the symbols constituting a message. In Shannon's theory messages are characterized only by their probabilities, regardless of their value or meaning. The main point of discussion about the applicability of IT to explain the information flow in biological systems is that in a classic communication channel, the symbols that conform the coded message are transmitted one by one in an independent form through a noisy communication channel, and noise can alter each of the symbols, distorting the message; in contrast, in a genetic communication channel the coded messages are not transmitted in the form of symbols but signaling cascades transmit them. Consequently, the information flow from the emitter to the effector is due to a series of coupled physicochemical processes that must ensure the accurate transmission of the message. In this review we discussed a novel proposal to overcome this difficulty, which consists of the modeling of gene expression with a stochastic approach that allows Shannon entropy (H) to be directly used to measure the amount of uncertainty that the genetic machinery has in relation to the correct decoding of a message transmitted into the nucleus by a signaling pathway. From the value of H we can define a function I that measures the amount of information content in the input message that the cell's genetic machinery is processing during a given time interval. Combining Information Theory with the frequency response analysis of dynamical systems we can examine the cell's genetic response to input signals with varying frequencies, amplitude and form, in order to determine if the cell can distinguish between different regimes of information flow from the environment.},

abstract = {High-volume air samplers were used to collect aerosol samples on Whatman 41 air filters at the Canadian air sampling stations Burnt Island, Egbert, and Point Petre. Once collected, the samples were analyzed for trace elements by neutron activation analysis. Air concentrations of over 30 trace elements were determined. A special focus was made to utilize Compton suppression gamma-ray spectroscopy and epithermal irradiations to enhance the detection limits of neutron activation analysis. These techniques allowed for the determination of trace elements at very low levels. Results of the study of the trace-metal dry deposition into Lakes Huron and Ontario indicated that the majority of the total deposition resulted from crustal materials. However, dry deposition is also a significant pathway for many toxic anthropogenic trace metals into the Great Lakes.},

abstract = {NFCSim is an event-driven, time-dependent simulation code modeling the flow of materials through the nuclear fuel cycle. NFCSim tracks mass flow at the level of discrete reactor fuel charges/discharges and logs the history of nuclear material as it progresses through a detailed series of processes and facilities, generating life-cycle material balances for any number of reactors. NFCSim is an ideal tool for analysis-of the economics, sustainability, or proliferation resistance-of nonequilibrium, interacting, or evolving reactor fleets. The software couples with a criticality and burnup engine, LACE (Los Alamos Criticality Engine). LACE implements a piecewise-linear, reactor-specific reactivity model for its criticality calculations. This model constructs fluencedependent reactivity traces for any facility; it is designed to address nuclear economies in which either a steady state is never obtained or is a poor approximation. LACE operates in transient and equilibrium fuel management regimes at the refueling batch level, derives reactor- and cycle-dependent initial fuel compositions, and invokes ORIGEN2.x to carry out burnup calculations.},

abstract = {The information content of an organism determines to a large extent its ability to perform the basic vital functions: selection of food, breaking up of the food molecules into appropriate parts, selection of those parts, and their assimilation. The information content needed is very large and requires a sufficiently large complexity of the organism. The information content of an organism is largely determined by the information content of the constituent organic molecules. The information content of the latter is in its turn determined by the number of physically distinguishable atoms or radicals of which the molecule is composed. The different arrangements of atoms in a molecule are represented by the structural formula, which is basically a graph. It is shown that the topology of this graph also determines to a large extent the information content. Different points of a graph may be physically indistinguishable; in general, however, they are different in regard to their topological properties. A study of the relations between the topological properties of graphs and their information content is suggested, and several theorems are demonstrated. A relation between topology and living processes is thus found also on the molecular level.},

abstract = {A set $\lambda$ of stochastic variables, y1 ,y2, \ldots, yn, is grouped into subsets, µ1, µ2, ..., µk. The correlation existing in $\lambda$ with respect to the µ's is adequately expressed by an equation where S($\nu$) is the entropy function defined with reference to the variables y in subset $\nu$. For a given $\lambda$, C becomes maximum when each µi consists of only one variable, (n = k). The value C is then called the total correlation in $\lambda$, Ctot($\lambda$). The present paper gives various theorems, according to which Ctot($\lambda$) can be decomposed in terms of the partial correlations existing in subsets of $\lambda$, and of quantities derivable therefrom. The information-theoretical meaning of each decomposition is carefully explained. As illustrations, two problems are discussed at the end of the paper: (1) redundancy in geometrical figures in pattern recognition, and (2) randomization effect of shuffling cards marked “zero” or “one.”},

abstract = {An RDD attack against the U.S. is something America needs to prepare against. If such an event occurs the ability to quickly identify the source of the radiological material used in an RDD would aid investigators in identifying the perpetrators. Spent fuel is one of the most dangerous possible radiological sources for an RDD. In this work, a forensics methodology was developed and implemented to attribute spent fuel to a source reactor. The specific attributes determined are the spent fuel burnup, age from discharge, reactor type, and initial fuel enrichment. It is shown that by analyzing the post-event material, these attributes can be determined with enough accuracy to be useful for investigators. The burnup can be found within a 5\% accuracy, enrichment with a 2\% accuracy, and age with a 10\% accuracy. Reactor type can be determined if specific nuclides are measured. The methodology developed was implemented into a code call NEMASYS. NEMASYS is easy to use and it takes a minimum amount of time to learn its basic functions. It will process data within a few minutes and provide detailed information about the results and conclusions.},

However, the repository is more than a decade behind schedule, and the nuclear waste generally remains at the commercial nuclear reactor sites and DoE sites where it was generated. This report examines the key attributes, challenges, and costs of the Yucca Mountain repository and the two principal alternatives to a repository that nuclear waste management experts identified: storing the nuclear waste at two centralized locations and continuing to store the waste on site where it was generated.
