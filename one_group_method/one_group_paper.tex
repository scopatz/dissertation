\section{Introduction}
\index{Introduction@\emph{Introduction}}
\label{1g_sec:intro}
Coupled neutron transport and fuel burnup calculations require large execution times
and intensive computational resources.  This constraint renders such calculations impractical when 
attempting to address high-level fuel cycle engineering problems on a reasonable time scale.  
The approaches taken in the past to circumvent these time constraints have typically sacrificed 
fidelity by fully decoupling the fuel cycle simulation from physics-based reactor burnup calculations 
\cite{Jacobson2009}.  

Fuel cycle problems revolve around perturbing input paramter values and measuring cooresponding component or
systemic changes which result. For instance, initial fresh fuel compositions in a reactor may be varied 
to attain a specific 
burnup. Or repository impact may be studied by varying the cooling time before emplacement.  Even 
the simplest once-through fuel cycle, when making isotopic considerations, has a large number of degrees of 
freedom, each 
featuring a continuum of acceptable values.  Lengthy calculation times going from input to output fuel vectors 
makes a parameterization of these degrees of freedom a near impossibility.  

Rather than relying on predetermined recipes that limit study to specific cores with precise burnups, 
there is a need for an essential physics mechanism that allows for quick, dynamic calculation of burnup 
parameters.  The methodology that is described within details a tool for use in fuel cycle analyses 
that calculates these burnup-related parameters for any reactor or interacting fleet of reactors.

The burnup-related parameters include the input and output isotopic vectors for the reactor 
as well as the burnup itself, which in turn depends on criticality, allowable fluence, safety issues 
such as reactivity coefficient values, and other constraints.  Other parameters may be of interest 
for specific fuel cycles and will be discussed as they arise.  The burnup tool uses pre-tabulated 
values for the neutron production and destruction rates and the burnup as a function of initial 
isotope present and fluence.  The algorithm then determines the burnup-fluence relationship, giving the 
burnup only in terms of the initial isotopics of the reactor.  The initial isotopics of the core may be iterated 
using this process until the composition that reaches some target burnup is found.  This process 
assumes that there are multiple actinide streams to be blended, and the blending ratios are unknowns 
to be computed.  The output isotopics of the reactor are dependent on initial core composition and 
the burnup, and thus are calculated after other parameters.   This tool may then be embedded within 
a full fuel cycle model.  To demonstrate how such a coupled framework functions, it is applied to 
two fuel cycle concepts.  Because the neutron production and destruction rates are integral 
quatities over all energy, this reactor model is known as the one-group method.

The first of the two fuel cycles incorporates a limited uranium recycle strategy.   Uranium from a 
standard pressurized water reactor (PWR) is reprocessed and blended with enriched natural uranium 
(NU) before going into the second core to be burned again.  After this burn, it is noteworthy that 
further recycling via blending is still possible.  In other words, this fuel cycle could be fully 
closed with respect to the uranium stream, avoiding the need to dispose of the reprocessed uranium 
that comprises over 90\% of the mass of spent PWR fuel on an initial heavy metal (IHM) basis.  
This is known as a recyclable uranium (RU) blend and burn fuel cycle since the uranium is reused 
in PWRs independently of other actinides.  RU blend and burn is an attractive option since it has 
the potential to eventually do a near complete burn of all uranium in LWR spent fuel if used in a 
fully closed cycle.

The second fuel cycle that utilizes the burnup tool developed here demonstrates how the tool may 
be used to improve the fidelity of the fuel cycle material balance calculations associated with 
one of the Advanced Fuel Cycle Research and Development (AFC R\&D) base-case proposals \cite{PC-000555}.  
This case is a closed fuel cycle that uses a fast burner reactor (FR) with a conversion ratio of 0.5.  
Actinides are continually recycled in the FR while fission products (FP) are removed and 
disposed.  The reprocessing facility that is built for fast reactor spent fuel has a separation 
efficiency of 0.99 for all actinides.  This is a meaningful option to explore since fast reactors 
are considered to be a key component of long term nuclear energy strategies that close the fuel cycle.

In these two instances the same basic algorithm is used to very quickly solve the blending problem 
to obtain the fresh fuel composition that achieves the desired discharge burnup (BUd); the isotopic 
content of the output is also calculated.   A fuel cycle wrapper governs the mass streams through 
the reactors and other fuel cycle components.  

As will be seen, many fuel cycle parameters may be calculated from the resulting data.  Moreover 
due to the dynamic nature of this method, these parameters will be more accurate 
than if a static recipe or simple linearization had been used.  A static recipe would not be able 
to mix recyclable and low enriched uranium (LEU) streams in a way that respects the dependence of 
neutronic characteristics on feed composition, an issue that is inherent to the RU fuel cycle.  
Moreover, models that use static recipes may fail to accurately capture the evolution of material 
balances with each successive pass through a fast reactor.   

The remainder of the one-group discussion proceeds as follows. \S \ref{1g_sec:bu_model} provides a 
full illustration of the burnup model.  \S \ref{1g_sec:fc} discusses in depth the recyclable 
uranium and fast reactor fuel cycles to which the burnup model is applied.  Next \S \ref{1g_sec:fcmodel_benchmark}
presents the results obtained for these cycles.  The final section is concludes the one-group 
discussion. 




\section{Burnup Model}
\index{Burnup Model@\emph{Burnup Model}}
\label{1g_sec:bu_model}
The burnup model takes a given input isotopic composition and returns the maximum discharge 
burnup of the fuel as well as its post-irradiation isotopic composition.  Thus, if given a 
target burnup, the model can mix multiple material streams to solve for the fresh fuel composition 
that achieves this burnup.

The burnup model algorithm takes several quantities as inputs.
The neutron production and destruction rates, the burnup, and the compositional evolution of 
every isotope initially present.  Furthermore, 
these parameters are all specified as functions of fluence (F), the time integral of the total spatially-averaged 
flux in the reactor. A discussion of how to compute and compile these presupposed parameters follows 
later in this section. 


\subsection{Isotopic Transformation}
\index{Isotopic Transformation@\emph{Isotopic Transformation}}
\label{1g_sec:iso_transform}
The first of the burnup model parameters is the nuclide-specific transformation as a 
function of fluence.  Let the subscript $i$ denote
the isotope initially present in the core, where as the subscript $j$ labels those nuclides bred in.  
Hence $T_{ij}(F)$ [kg\subscript{j}/kg\subscript{i}] tracks the transmutation under fluence 
of the $i$\superscript{th} isotope into its daughters 
given a nominal reactor spectrum embodied by one-group cross sections.  The daughters tracked 
include both fission products (FP) as well as transuranics (TRU).
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{\nuc{Pu}{239} Transformation as a Function of Fluence for a Sample Fast Reactor}
\label{1g_fig01}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig01.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{1g_fig01} displays an example of this transformation data: the concentration in 
kilograms of tracked isotopes that are present in a sodium-cooled FR core as a function of 1 kg 
of the initial isotope (\nuc{Pu}{239}).  In the figure, only one isotope 
is non-zero at zero fluence (\emph{i.e.} zero time in the reactor).  For each 
reactor and fuel form, similar data are required for all transmuting 
nuclides initially present.   Note that not all species that \nuc{Pu}{239} transforms into are displayed
in Figure \ref{1g_fig01}. 

Since this example is for fast reactors, a constant flux of $2\times10^{15}$ [n/cm2/s] was used 
when generating the transformation matrices.  For PWRs a constant flux of 
$4\times10^{14}$ [n/cm\superscript{2}/s] 
was assumed.  The units of fluence ($F$) here are [neutrons/kilobarn], abbreviated [n/kb], while the 
flux ($\phi$) is again [n/cm\superscript{2}/s], and time ($t$) is given in [days].
\begin{equation}
\label{fluence}
F = \int_0^t \phi dt^\prime = \phi \int_0^t dt^\prime = \phi \times t \cdot \frac{24 \cdot 3600 \cdot 10^3}{10^{24}}
\end{equation}
In practice, the $T_{ij}$ data need only exist for the actinides because coolant and structural 
material transmutation does not significantly impact core neutronic performance.

From here it is simple to apply initial isotopic weight fractions and the principle of superposition 
to Figure \ref{1g_fig01} and its analogies for all isotopes initially present in the core.  This superimposed result then describes 
how 1 kg of fresh fuel transforms as a function of fluence within the core. Once the burnup model is applied, 
the output fluence will also be known (described below).  Plugging the discharge fluence into the superimposed data 
yields the isotopic composition of the fuel at removal. 



\subsection{Neutron Production \& Destruction Rates and Burnup}
\index{Neutron Production \& Destruction Rates and Burnup@\emph{Neutron Production \& Destruction Rates and Burnup}}
\label{1g_sec:pdbu}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{Sample Neutron Production and Destruction Rate Figure as a Function of Fluence for an Initial Unit Mass of \nuc{Pu}{239} in a Sample Fast Reactor}
\label{1g_fig02}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig02.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Other fuel cycle parameters that are required to perform burnup calculations are the neutron 
production and destruction rates, $p_i(F)$ and $d_i(F)$ [n/s/flux/kg\subscript{i}].  These are given 
as functions of fluence for each isotope initially present in the core, just as with the isotopic 
transformation data.  An example of these parameters is shown in Figure \ref{1g_fig02}.
This figure displays the production and destruction rates for one initial kilogram of \nuc{Pu}{239} 
in the sodium-cooled FR.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{Burnup as a Function of Fluence for an Initial Unit Mass of Specific Nuclides in a Sample Fast Reactor}
\label{1g_fig03}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig03.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Lastly, the specific burnup for each isotope initially present, $\mbox{BU}_i(F)$ 
[MWd/kg\subscript{i}] must also be given to the burnup model.  The burnup is defined 
in the same way as the neutron 
production and destruction rates.  It is given as a function of fluence for each nuclide initially 
present in the core.  Figure \ref{1g_fig03} displays $\mbox{BU}_i(F)$ for a few actinides that may 
be present in the fresh fuel.
Now that all input quantities have been outlined and defined, a description of the 
algorithm that calculates the discharge burnup and the input and output fuel isotopics follows.   




\subsection{Solving for BUd and Isotopics}
\index{Solving for BUd and Isotopics@\emph{Solving for BUd and Isotopics}}
\label{1g_sec:solve_BUd_iso}
First, knowing only the $\mbox{BU}_i(F)$, $p_i(F)$, $d_i(F)$, and $T_{ij}(F)$,
the maximum achievable discharge burnup BUd [MWd/kgIHM] must be found.  The burnup of the fresh 
fuel as a function of fluence is then computed as a mass-weighted linear combination of the burnups 
from the initial constituent isotopes.  Similarly, the neutron production and destruction rates as a 
function of fluence for an arbitrary fresh fuel may be found.  In the development below, it is 
assumed that the core consists of a lattice in which each cell contains two spatial regions, the fuel ``F'' 
and the coolant ``C''. (This formulation could generalize to additional regions.)  Denote the mass of the 
$i$\superscript{th} isotope initially present in the fuel region ``F'' per unit mass of initial heavy 
metal (IHM) in the cell by $m_i^F$ [kg\subscript{i}/kgIHM] and the mass of the $i$\superscript{th} 
isotope initially present in the coolant region ``C'' per unit mass of IHM by 
$m_i^C$ [kg\subscript{i}/kgIHM].  Thus for the ``Q''\superscript{th} region, the mass weights are given 
by equation \ref{Q_mass_weights}.
\begin{equation}
\label{Q_mass_weights}
m_i^Q = \frac{N_i^Q}{N_{\mbox{IHM}}} = \frac{n_i^Q A_i}{A_{\mbox{IHM}}} \cdot \frac{\rho^Q\cdot\mbox{MW}^F}{\rho^F\cdot\mbox{MW}^Q} \frac{V^Q}{V^F}
\end{equation}
Here, $N_i$ is the number density, $n_i$ is the atom fraction, $A_i$ [amu] is the atomic weight, 
$\rho$ [g/cm\superscript{3}] is the density, and $\mbox{MW}$ [g/mol] is the molecular weight.

Note that the volumes of the fuel and coolant regions, $V^F$ and $V^C$ [cm\superscript{3}], are also needed to 
compute the IHM-normalized masses.  An infinite lattice made up of the unit cells mentioned 
above is used for this purpose.  This two region method ignores the small 
effect of the cladding material on neutron capture.  Call $r$ [cm] the radius of the fuel pin and $\ell$ [cm] 
the pitch of the unit fuel cell.  Additionally it is important to correct for the fact that not all fuel 
pin slots in a fuel assembly are filled with fuel.  Denote $S_T$ as the total number of pin 
slots in a fuel assembly and $S_O$ as the open, non-fuel containing slots.  The effective volumes 
are then given in equations \ref{1g_VF} \& \ref{1g_VC}.
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_VF}
V^F = \frac{\pi r^2}{\ell^2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{S_O}{S_T}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_VC}
V^C = \frac{\ell^2 - \pi r^2}{\ell^2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{S_O}{S_T}\right) + \frac{S_O}{S_T}
\end{equation}
Hence the burnup of the core as a function of fluence $\mbox{BU}(F)$ [MWd/kgIHM] is given by 
the following sum.
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_BU_F}
\mbox{BU}(F) = \sum_i m_i^F \cdot \mbox{BU}_i(F)
\end{equation}
Once this burnup is known, the maximum discharge burnup can be computed via the fluence point 
for which the core ceases to be critical.  The fluence-dependent neutron production and destruction 
rates for each constituent species are used to compute the multiplication factor, $k$.    

When $k$ drops 
below unity, a reactor full of this nuclide alone would no longer be able to sustain a chain reaction.  $k(F)$ is 
approximated by calculating the full-core neutron production rate $P(F)$ [n/s/kgIHM] divided by the 
full-core average neutron destruction rate $D(F)$ [n/s/kgIHM].  
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_k_F}
k(F) = \frac{P(F)}{D(F)}
\end{equation}
$k(F)$ may thus also be calculated, like $\mbox{BU}(F)$, as a mass-weighted convolution of the $p_i(F)$ and 
$d_i(F)$.  The method by which one obtains $P(F)$ and $D(F)$ from the isotope-specific rates is discussed 
in the following sections.  Once computed, $k(F)$ is then set equal to unity and equation \ref{1g_k_F} 
is solved for the fluence.  This point is the fluence at discharge and is denoted $F\mbox{d}$ [n/kb].  
$F\mbox{d}$ may then be reinserted into equation \ref{1g_BU_F} and the burnup of the fuel composition at discharge 
BUd [MWd/kgIHM] is attained.

Note that equation \ref{1g_k_F} can hold for a multi-batch fuel management scheme as well as a one batch core 
system.  Extending this equation to a multi-batch system may be seen in \S \ref{1g_sec:batch_ave}.

Additional factors complicate the calculation of the core-average neutron production and destruction rates.  
A complete depiction of the neutron balance requires that $p_i(F)$ and $d_i(F)$ for non-fuel components of 
the core must also be known.  These non-fuel components include the coolant outside of fuel regions and the 
non-actinide species in the fuel region (\emph{e.g.} oxygen in UOX).  Both of these classes of parasitic 
species serve to increase the full core destruction rate.  Disadvantage factors also reflect that there is flux 
suppression in fuel regions, which needs to be accounted for in PWR cases.  Furthermore, to 
account for spatial variation in the neutron flux when computing neutron interaction rates in non-fuel 
components, a general fuel assembly model is needed (as described above).  For example, to reflect a 
standard PWR fuel assembly geometry values from the OECD Burnup Credit Criticality Benchmark \cite{Takano1994} 
were used for LWRs and nominal values for fast reactors were taken from \cite{INL/CON-07-12478}.  

A walkthrough of how to calculate the core-average production and destruction rates, $P(F)$ and $D(F)$, 
from the known set of $p_i(F)$ and $d_i(F)$ for a given collection of $m_i$ follows.  




\subsubsection{The Neutron Production Rate}
\index{The Neutron Production Rate@\emph{The Neutron Production Rate}}
\label{1g_sec:p_rate}
The $p_i(F)$ and $d_i(F)$ are superimposed to build the full-core loading.  These rates reflect the 
evolution of the neutron balance for an initial unit mass of the species $i$ when exposed to the 
neutron flux spectrum in the reactor being studied.  Therefore they are computed using cross 
sections prepared for a specific reactor and fresh fuel composition.

However as mentioned above, flux spectra and magnitudes are spatially dependent.  The most basic geometric 
model is that of an infinite lattice of unit cells consisting of a central fuel region 
surrounded by a coolant-filled region.  These two regions have neutron production and destruction rates that 
are distinct since the set of $m_i$ that are used in each region is different.  

The production rates for the fuel and coolant regions, $p^F(F)$ and $p^C(F)$ [n/s/flux/kgIHM], 
can be calculated in direct analogy to equation \ref{1g_BU_F} for the burnup.  The neutron production 
rate in the fuel region is 
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_pF_F}
p^F(F) = \sum_i m_i^F \cdot p_i(F)
\end{equation}
and $p^C(F) = 0$ since the coolant contains no neutron producing isotopes.  

The advantage of this algorithm is seen through equation \ref{1g_pF_F}.  By assuming that isotopic 
production and destruction rates are known, superposition is then used combine the individual rates 
into full-core or region specific rates.  This allows for fast recombining of initial core species without 
having to recalculate the isotopic rates from scratch.  For instance, to calculate the burnups achievable 
from 2\% and 4\% \nuc{U}{235} enriched PWR fuel would typically require distinct computationally intensive 
runs because of differing initial fuel compositions.  With this method all, that is needed is to change the 
$m_i$ used in equation \ref{1g_pF_F}.   For greater fidelity, one may obtain case-specific burnup parameters $p_i(F)$, 
$d_i(F)$ and $\mbox{BU}_i(F)$ and interpolate between a handful of precomputed sets.  

However, the fuel region production rate is not equivalent to the full-core production rate.  The 
core effect that is not seen at the fuel cell level is known as leakage.  To capture this macroscopic effect a 
non-leakage probability $P_{NL}$ is introduced.  The $P_{NL}$ effectively reduces the production rate of 
neutrons in the core. The $P_{NL}$ used is characteristic of the reactor design and composition; it may 
be computed using macroscopic transport methods, but in practice it is used as a calibration parameter.  
Finally then, the full-core production rate is given simply as 
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_P_F}
P(F) = P_{NL} \cdot p^F(F)
\end{equation}
Note that $P(F)$ here is normalized to a unit mass of IHM.  Thus $P(F)$ has units of [n/s/kgIHM].
The neutron destruction rate must therefore be normalized in the same way.



\subsubsection{The Destruction Rate}
\index{The Destruction Rate@\emph{The Destruction Rate}}
\label{1g_sec:d_rate}
The full-core destruction rate $D(F)$ is calculated in the same manner as the fuel 
region production rate.  However, the other nuclides in the reactor, while not contributing 
to fission, do contribute to neutron destruction in the core.  In the fuel cell model used above, 
two other isotopes are present in a PWR core (\nuc{O}{16} and \nuc{H}{1}) and one other main species 
in a FR core (\nuc{Na}{23}).

To compute $D(F)$, the fuel region 
destruction rate $d^F(F)$, in analogy to the fuel region production rate equation \ref{1g_pF_F}, 
is required.  Note that the 
units of $d^F(F)$ are [n/s/flux/kgIHM].  
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_dF_F}
d^F(F) = \sum_i m_i^F \cdot d_i(F)
\end{equation}
Moreover, the coolant can strongly contribute to the destruction rate.  However, it is 
important to take into account that for some fuel/coolant combinations the flux is not 
spatially uniform.  For instance, in PWRs the thermal flux is generally higher in the coolant 
than in the fuel. To account for this, a disadvantage factor is introduced.  For other reactor 
types, such as FRs, the flux profile is much flatter over the unit cell and a disadvantage 
factor is not necessary. The disadvantage factor $\zeta$ is qualitatively the average flux in 
the coolant divided by the average flux in the fuel. The fuel suppresses the thermal flux 
levels so $\zeta$ will always be greater than one.
Since $\zeta$ is dependent on the composition of the fuel  it
is also a function of the fluence. A more complete examination of how to calculate $\zeta(F)$ is 
found in \cite{Lamarsh2002}.  Figure \ref{1g_fig04} 
shows how $\zeta(F)$ changes with fluence for two LEU fuels with 3.2\% and 4.3\% \nuc{U}{235}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{Disadvantage Factor as a Function of Fluence for LEU with a Three Batch Core}
\label{1g_fig04}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig04.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Thus the coolant destruction rate is then given as
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_dC_F}
d^C(F) = \zeta(F) \cdot \sum_i m_i^C \cdot d_i(F)
\end{equation}
Note that the volumetric weight in $m_i^C$ for the coolant region already includes both 
empty and filled fuel pin slots.  Therefore the full-core destruction rate $D(F)$ is given by 
the sum of the destruction rate in the fuel and the destruction rate in the coolant.  
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_D_F}
D(F) = d^F(F) + d^C(F)
\end{equation}
Now that $P(F)$ and $D(F)$ are known, $k(F)$ may be calculated as per equation \ref{1g_k_F}.  
Once again, $F\mbox{d}$ is defined such that $k(F\mbox{d}) = 1$ which yields the maximum discharge 
burnup $\mbox{BU}(F\mbox{d}) = \mbox{BUd}$.




\subsubsection{Multiple Batch Cores}
\index{Multiple Batch Cores@\emph{Multiple Batch Cores}}
\label{1g_sec:batch_ave}
What has been shown above is how to find the discharge burnup with a given fuel composition for a one
batch system.  However, for multiple batches of fuel the process is less straightforward as the 
production and destruction rates are averaged over their end of cycle values for each batch.  
The strategy employed here is to perform these operations in reverse and then iterate over them.  
In other words, one picks a burnup and then solves for the multiplication factor.  Then one picks 
another burnup that will yield a $k$ closer to one and solves again for $k$.  This process continues 
until a $k$ is found that is acceptably close to one.  

The bisection method is preferred to pick successively closer values of $k$.  It is not prone to the 
erratic behavior that arises when Newton's method is used with pointwise data.   Furthermore, the 
bisection method ensures that the fuel is burnable.  The bisection method requires that there must 
be both some fluence where $k < 1$ and a fluence such that $1 < k$.  Since the multiplication factor 
is in reality continuous and roughly monotonic, these conditions imply that at some fluence $k = 1$.  
However, if these conditions fail then the fuel has too little fissile material to sustain a chain reaction. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{Burnup as a Function of Fluence for Sample FR Fuel}
\label{1g_fig05}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig05.eps}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{The Multiplication Factor as a Function of Fluence for Sample FR Fuel}
\label{1g_fig06}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig06.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A walkthrough of this process for multiple batches follows.  First, a maximum 
discharge burnup BUd is guessed.  Say without loss of generality that the system at hand is 
concerned with a three batch refueling cycle.  Then assuming equal inter-batch power sharing, 
the fluence must be found for three burnups, namely BUd, 2/3 BUd, and 1/3 BUd.   Lines drawn on 
Figure \ref{1g_fig05} from the burnup axis to the curve and then down from the curve to the fluence 
axis will give the fluence at the three points required.  Note that the highest fluence ($F3$ here) 
is the fluence at discharge $F\mbox{d}$.  After the fluence for each of the burnups has been calculated, 
the multiplication factor of the system needs to be known. 

To achieve this for a multibatch core, a flux-weighted batch averaging procedure is followed.  
The multiplication factor at each fluence is determined by the $P(F)/D(F)$ ratio.  Denote the batch 
number that a parameter is associated with by the subscript ``b''.  In Figure \ref{1g_fig06}, 
the three $k_b$s correspond to the three fluences chosen via the three burnup
points on Figure \ref{1g_fig05},  $k_b(F_b) = P_b(F_b)/D_b(F_b)$.  
These are interpreted as the multiplication factors if the full core was in fact composed entirely 
of fuel that had been exposed to this fluence. Thus the true multiplication factor of the core is 
the weighted average of the production divided by destruction rates.  With the flux as a weight for 
``B'' batches,
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_k_batch_ave}
k = \frac{\sum_b^B \frac{P_b(F_b)}{D_b(F_b)} \phi_b}{\sum_b^B \phi_b}
\end{equation}
However, the average flux within each batch $\phi_b$ is not known.  
Moreover, because the batch power remains constant, $\phi_b$ does not.  Yet the flux is by definition the time 
derivative of the fluence. Thus a good approximation of the flux is given in equation \ref{1g_phi_b}.
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_phi_b}
\phi_b \approx \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
Here, $\Delta F$ can be measured at a given fluence by perturbing $\mbox{BU}(F)$ by a small amount 
and finding the $\Delta\mbox{BU}$.  This is easily done as $\Delta\mbox{BU}/\Delta F$ is identically 
the slope of the $\mbox{BU}(F)$ graph at fluence $F$ in Figure \ref{1g_fig05}.  Given the 
assumption of constant power density, a change in burnup yields a corresponding change in time such that
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_delta_t}
\Delta t = \Delta\mbox{BU} \cdot \frac{T_{\mbox{res}}}{\mbox{BUd}}
\end{equation}
Where BUd is the discharge burnup guess and $T_{\mbox{res}}$ [days] is the residence time that the 
fuel took to obtain this burnup. Combining equations \ref{1g_phi_b} \& \ref{1g_delta_t}, 
$\phi_b$ is found to be
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_phi_b_1}
\phi_b \approx \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta \mbox{BU}} \cdot \frac{T_{\mbox{res}}}{\mbox{BUd}}
\end{equation}
By inserting equation \ref{1g_phi_b_1} into equation \ref{1g_k_batch_ave}, an expression for the effective 
multiplication factor for a multiple batch system at discharged time is obtained.
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_k_batch_ave_1}
k \approx \frac{\sum_b^B \frac{P_b(F_b)}{D_b(F_b)} \cdot \left. \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta \mbox{BU}} \right|_b \cdot \frac{T_{\mbox{res}}}{\mbox{BUd}}}
                {\sum_b^B \left. \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta \mbox{BU}} \right|_b \cdot \frac{T_{\mbox{res}}}{\mbox{BUd}}}
 =  \frac{\sum_b^B \frac{P_b(F_b)}{D_b(F_b)} \cdot \left. \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta \mbox{BU}} \right|_b }
                {\sum_b^B \left. \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta \mbox{BU}} \right|_b}
\end{equation}

Now that a batch-averaged $k$ has been found, its value may be converged to unity via the bisection iterations.  Another 
value of the maximum discharge burnup may then chosen and this process repeated until a BUd is found 
that yields a $k = 1$.  

In the process of determining the maximum discharge burnup, $F\mbox{d}$ is also found.  Analogously, a  
mass-weighted linear combination of the isotopic transformation matrices may be performed. 
The mass of the $j$\superscript{th} 
nuclide at fluence $F$ is called $M_j(F)$ [kg\subscript{j}/kgIHM] and is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_trans_Mj}
M_j(F) = \sum_i m_i^F \cdot T_{ij}(F)
\end{equation}
Plugging in the fluence at discharge 
$F\mbox{d}$ into equation \ref{1g_trans_Mj} will yield the mass of isotope $j$ in the spent fuel per 
kilogram of IHM.  Performing this operation for all $j$ isotopes of interest will yield the isotopic 
output vector for the core.  Since fission product masses were included in the transformation matrices, 
the fission products at discharge are also known.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{$M_j(F)$ for a Sample Fast Reactor for a Variety of Species}
\label{1g_fig07}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig07.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{1g_fig07} shows a graphical representation of the $M_j(F)$ for various isotopes present 
in a fast reactor.  Each curve for each nuclide is the superposition of all of the transformation 
matrices.  Some species, such as \nuc{U}{238} and \nuc{Pu}{239}, 
are burned out of the core faster than they are bred back in and are therefore represented by lines of 
negative slope.  Other isotopes, namely fission products, were not initially present and are bred into 
the core by any fissioning species.  These are shown as the curves growing towards some asymptote.  
Still other nuclides, higher order species like \nuc{Am}{243} and \nuc{Cm}{244}, have a more dynamic effect.  
They grow into the core, peak, and start to burn out.  

In conclusion, the above is an algorithm for finding the maximum discharge burnup and its discharge 
composition given only a fuel form represented by $m_i^F$, the pre-generated burnup parameters ($p_i(F)$, 
$d_i(F)$, $\mbox{BU}_i(F)$, and $T_{ij}(F)$), the number of batches in the core $B$, and the non-leakage 
probability $P_{NL}$.  Methods for generating these burnup parameters are disscussed in 
\S \ref{1g_sec:gen_BU_param}.



\subsection{Burnup Parameter Generation}
\index{Burnup Parameter Generation@\emph{Burnup Parameter Generation}}
\label{1g_sec:gen_BU_param}
The burnup parameters $p_i(F)$, $d_i(F)$, $\mbox{BU}_i(F)$, and $T_{ij}(F)$ are typically calculated 
for a specific reactor design.  However if the reactor type is perceived as being representative of 
all cores of that type, then the burnup parameters may be applied generally to all reactors of this 
type without having to recalculate new parameterizations.
Qualitatively, what it means to be representative of a reactor type and fuel composition is that the 
neutron energy spectrum inherent in the few-group cross sections used to generate the burnup parameters 
is similar to that of other reactors of this type and other fuel compositions that will be studied.   

In this study, the burnup parameters are calculated and tabulated based on the reactor-specific data 
libraries created from ORIGEN 2.2 \cite{Croff2002} isotope-specific burnup analyses.  The ORIGEN 
input libraries contain cross sections that are interpreted as generic to a reactor type and range of 
fuel compositions.  For example, the libraries used here for fast reactors were prepared for a sodium 
cooled burner reactor with a target conversion ratio of 0.5.  This reactor is described in more detail 
in \cite{INL/CON-07-12478}.  The burnup model therefore utilizes pre-computed libraries of the 
$p_i(F)$, $d_i(F)$, $\mbox{BU}_i(F)$, and $T_{ij}(F)$ that were built up from ORIGEN runs.  
These libraries contain pointwise data as a function of fluence.  Recall that all data in these 
libraries track the evolution of the parameter on a per unit mass basis.

More explicitly, ORIGEN 2.2 is run for a kilogram mass of a given nuclide with the characteristic 
input libraries.  Therefore, the isotopic mass balances and reaction rates obtained from this run 
reflect the evolution of one kilogram of this isotope within the core.  The ORIGEN output is then 
parsed and placed in the appropriate libraries for usage by the burnup model.  These ORIGEN runs are 
performed for all nuclides in the core.  Naturally, if one were to use initial ORIGEN libraries for a 
different reactor type, then the tables and matrices generated here would be representative of this 
other reactor.  These libraries only need to be generated once for a given reactor type, geometry 
and representative fuel composition.

In addition, the representative cycle-average neutron energy spectrum changes with BUd.  This is because 
more initial fissile fuel is needed to achieve increased burnups.  Even for an identical fuel to coolant volume 
ratio the spectral dependence on burnup is often too large to neglect.  Thus for thermal-spectrum systems 
ORIGEN input libraries are prepared for a number of differing BUds.  For PWRs libraries 
representative of 20, 33 and 50 MWd/kgIHM discharge burnups have been used.  These 
libraries are interpolated to create customized libraries at any burnup in this range.  They thus 
capture the dependence of the cycle-average cross sections on discharge fluence and
initial isotopics.  This is of more significance to PWRs as fast reactor spectra are relatively more 
stable. To investigate high-burnup PWR fuels additional libraries for BUd of 70 and 100 MWd/kgIHM 
have been prepared using assumed initial \nuc{U}{235} enrichments of 5.5 and 8 w/o, respectively.

Even systems whose spectra are less sensitive to initial composition and burnup must be treated using a 
number of cross section libraries prepared from detailed transport calculations.  For the sodium-cooled 
FR design a number of libraries are available.  
Distinct sets of libraries were prepared for 0.5 (used in this study) and 0.25 target 
conversion ratio cores.  Additionally, separate libraries were prepared at each conversion ratio for 
fuels with higher and lower minor actinide (MA) content.   The higher MA case is representative of the 
feed to a FR if Pu from spent UOX is first burned in MOX, while the lower MA library, the one used in 
this study, reflects the TRU content with no MOX burn.



\subsubsection{Hydrogen Cross Section Rescaling}
\index{Hydrogen Cross Section Rescaling@\emph{Hydrogen Cross Section Rescaling}}
\label{1g_sec:H_rescale}
The one group cross sections are functions of fuel burnup and therefore fluence, in some cases quite 
strongly so.  The model supports the adjustment of \nuc{H}{1} cross sections, production 
and destruction rates, and transmutation rates as a function of fluence.  For instance, the effective 
one group radiative capture cross section of \nuc{H}{1} in typical PWR coolant changes significantly 
as the flux spectrum in the core evolves to maintain constant power density.  Just as with the interpolation 
of the ORIGEN input libraries, the hydrogen cross section may be parameterized around the burnup that the core 
has experienced.  Moreover, hydrogen contributes about 10\% to the total destruction rate in the core.  
Thus a significant change in the hydrogen cross section could yield an appreciable error in the model as 
formulated above.  What follows is more of an adjustment to the hydrogen one-group cross section than a 
true mutli-energy group response.  However, this adjustment provides an easy to calculate model to 
reduce the error induced into the neutron destruction rates by non-represntative hydrogen cross sections.

To account for these spectral variations an f-factor is introduced that is a function of the burnup 
$\mbox{BU}(F)$.    $f(F)$ is a unitless factor by which all hydrogen destruction rates $d_H(F)$ are 
multiplied by in equations \ref{1g_dF_F}-\ref{1g_D_F}. Two hydrogen cross sections are known for two 
burnups.  These were taken from the ORIGEN cross section libraries prepared for 33 and 50 MWd/kgIHM 
in PWRs.

Thus $f(F)$ is the computed by drawing the line between these two points and dividing it by the cross 
section that was used for the ORIGEN runs.  Since ORIGEN was run using the 33 MWd/kgIHM library, the 
line is simply divided by 0.03474 barns.  The equation for $f(F)$ is therefore, 
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_f_F}
f(F) = 1.36927 - 0.01119 \cdot \mbox{BU}(F)
\end{equation}
As is seen in this extrapolation, the per atom hydrogen neutron destruction rate can vary considerably.  
Multiplying $f(F)$ by $d_H(F)$ results in an increase of the accuracy of all destruction rate and 
multiplication factor data that is computed.  The inclusion of the hydrogen rescaling factor and 
subsequent effects on BUd and initial compositions will be discussed in a later section with regards 
to the example of standard PWRs.  



\section{Fuel Cycles}
\index{Fuel Cycles@\emph{Fuel Cycles}}
\label{1g_sec:fc}
The AFC R\&D plan for domestic fuel cycles offers many possible 
pathways.  With most of these options AFC R\&D hopes to reduce the stockpile of United States 
transuranics (TRU) and obviate the technical need for a second repository during this century.  
Separated transuranics are moreover seen as dangerous to nuclear non-proliferation goals.  
Furthermore, most TRU species negatively impact repository performance as compared to an equivalent 
mass of natural uranium (NU).  Two fuel cycles involving recycle - uranium recycle in PWRs and full TRU recycle in 
FRs - are examined here as case studies to which the method presented above is applied. 


\subsection{Uranium Recycle Fuel Cycle}
\index{Uranium Recycle Fuel Cycle@\emph{Uranium Recycle Fuel Cycle}}
\label{1g_sec:UFC}
The first of the fuel cycles that are analyzed here explores blending of RU with enriched NU to 
achieve sustained uranium recycle in light water reactors (LWR).  Since RU is a product of 
reprocessing light water reactor used fuel (LWR UF), the front end for the RU creation 
process includes the back end of the reprocessing based LWR-NU fuel cycle.  The application of the 
burnup model to the RU burning reactor will be demonstrated through the study of this fuel cycle.

Figure \ref{1g_fig08} depicts the RU blending option studied here.  Red arrows in Figure \ref{1g_fig08} 
connote RU flow stemming from the UREX+ reprocessing component or the enrichment component.  Black arrows 
that lead out of components indicate flows that do not comprise the mass input streams to the RU burning reactor.  
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{RU Fuel Cycle}
\label{1g_fig08}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig08.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Blending RU with enriched natural uranium is a method of increasing the fissile content of the RU while 
also impeding the buildup of \nuc{U}{236}, a neutron poison.  From the standpoint of the fuel cycle material 
balance alone, if the utilization of RU is to be maximized the best material to serve as a blend stock with 
RU is highly enriched uranium (HEU).  HEU is in limited supply as a blend stock and its use for civilian 
applications is undesirable.  Therefore if the blending strategy is to be implemented, the blend stock 
would be low enriched uranium (LEU).  

LWR UF contains a higher enrichment of \nuc{U}{235} than NU; therefore RU blending may be economically 
advantageous over the once-through fuel cycle given that reprocessing is already taking place to recover 
TRU. The weight percent of \nuc{U}{235} in the legacy spent fuel of the United States is between 
0.8-0.9\% \cite{Schneider2007}.  
However, LWR UF also has non-negligible amounts of \nuc{U}{236} bred into it, between 0.3-0.5\%.  
As \nuc{U}{236} is a neutron poison, the advantage of the extra \nuc{U}{235} in RU is not immediately 
quantitatively obvious.  Therefore, to increase the fissile content of an RU fuel form, it is blended 
with LEU. This LEU blend stock serves to dilute the \nuc{U}{236} and thereby decrease its negative 
impact on the neutron balance in the core. 

Fuel that goes into the RU reactor must be assigned a target burnup; for reasons of simplicity and 
practicality, it will be assumed that it is desirable to achieve parity between the traditional LEU- and 
RU-bearing fuel burnups.  Since the RU isotopic composition is set by the burnup in the initial reactor, 
the free parameters that are used to match the burnup of RU fuel to that of virgin LEU fuel in the reactor 
are the LEU enrichment and its mass fraction in the blended LEU-RU stream.    

The first blending option is that the mass of LEU blend stock per unit mass of RU is held constant.  
Thus the fissile content of the RU-bearing fuel is controlled by the enrichment of the LEU.  On the 
other hand, the LEU enrichment can be held constant and the mass that is mixed with the RU may be 
varied.  In this second case the LEU enrichment may be up to 19.9\%.  

It should be noted that higher LEU enrichment levels mean that more RU can be blended in.
Near-future enrichment plants will not be licensed to produce LEU at 
greater than 8\% \nuc{U}{235} enrichment. However, the LEU/HEU limit is 19.9\% so it is conceivable 
that if RU recycle came to fruition civilian enrichment facilities would be allowed to manufacture 19.9\% 
enriched product.  



\subsection{Fast Burner Reactor Fuel Cycle}
\index{Fast Burner Reactor Fuel Cycle@\emph{Fast Burner Reactor Fuel Cycle}}
\label{1g_sec:FRFC}
A fuel cycle which features sustained TRU recycle is the second one  examined.  The basis 
of the model used here is a fast reactor (FR) with LWR UF top up.  The purpose of this fuel cycle 
option is to reduce the global actinide inventory per unit energy as compared to the standard 
once-through fuel cycle, with the specific aim of reducing transuranics.   To this end, the FR 
conversion ratio (CR) is less than unity.  The nominal value for the conversion ratio in this 
study is taken to be 0.5, consistent with the baseline sodium-cooled fast transmuting reactor 
point design used in AFC R\&D scoping studies \cite{AFCI2005}.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{FR Fuel Cycle}
\label{1g_fig09}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{one_group_method/figs/Fig09.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{1g_fig09} depicts the FR fuel cycle that is studied.  Once again, mass flows 
represented in red are the four mass streams that form the FR fresh fuel blend stock.  The mass 
of each stream relative to the others may be varied by the burnup model to achieve a target burnup.  
The mass flows in black are the flows that are considered static to the burnup model and are not changed, 
though they may vary with fuel cycle pass number.  

Because of the dynamic nature of the burnup model, the discharge burnup is not fixed but rather a 
target BUd is set as a parameter within the model.  Alteration of the BUd will change the balance of the FR 
input mass streams as well as all dependent isotopics.  However, burnup values of 51 MWd/kg for the LWR and 
170 MWd/kg for the FR are used unless otherwise stated.  Both of these values were taken from the 
VISION \cite{Jacobson2009} 
specifications for nominal LWR and FR cases.  Similarly, spent fuel from both the LWRs and FRs is allowed to 
cool for a time before being reprocessed.  The time that spent fuel of any sort is allowed to cool also 
affects the isotopics and mass stream material balances.  The cooling time is again a parameter 
that may be specified within the fuel cycle model for which nominal values were taken here.

The input mass to the fast reactor is made up of four independent streams: depleted uranium coming from 
the tails of enrichment (DU), the transuranics coming from light water reactors (LWR-TRU), the uranium coming 
from fast reactors (FR-U), the transuranics coming from fast reactors (FR-TRU).  These streams are separated 
in the reprocessing facilities and then combined to form the input stream to the fast reactor.  The fission 
products from these streams are also removed from the fuel at this point and sent off to a disposal facility.  

It should be noted here that the reprocessing facility that deals with the light water reactor used 
fuel (LWR UF) and the reprocessing facility that handles the fast reactor used fuel (FR UF) 
would likely be collocated.

Lastly, Figure \ref{1g_fig09} represents a closed fuel cycle which implies that actinides may be recycled 
indefinitely or until they are eventually burned.  The constraint is that there exist enough FRs to handle 
the mass throughput.  As no separation process is perfect, some small 
actinide mass will be mixed with the fission products after reprocessing and be sent to the repository.  
It is known that the reprocessing separation efficiencies ultimately affect repository 
performance \cite{Wiegland2006}.  
However, because the isotopics change with every pass of TRU through the fuel cycle, there arises a mass 
stream feedback between the reactor burnup, the cooling time, and the reprocessing efficiencies. 
The burnup model handles such feedback effects with ease. 

The implication of a closed or partially closed fuel cycle is that mass may be sent through many recycles.  
For a specific target FR burnup and other fuel cycle parameters, the relative masses and the isotopics of 
the four mass streams (DU, LWR-TRU, FR-U, FR-TRU) may change significantly as a function of pass number.  
However, one would eventually expect that equilibrium values for the mass balances and isotopics will be 
reached.  Typically, such an equilibrium state is indeed obtained.  For some species though, equilibrium is not reached 
even after many recycles. In practice many decades, even centuries, would elapse before an 
equilibrium scenario result would reflect reality.  Therefore, equilibrium fuel cycle simulation 
results must be interpreted with caution.  When equilibrium is achieved and how it is defined is discussed
in a later section.  



\subsection{Cooling Model}
\index{Cooling Model@\emph{Cooling Model}}
\label{1g_sec:cool_model}
Before reprocessing occurs, light water reactor used fuel (LWR UF) and fast reactor used
fuel (FR UF) are typically stored and cooled.  This process represents the ``Storage'' boxes in 
fuel cycle Figures \ref{1g_fig08} \& \ref{1g_fig09}.  The cooling model computes the analytical solutions 
to the Bateman equations \cite{Stacey1959}: 
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_bateman}
m_j(t_C) = \left( m_1\gamma_1\lambda_1\gamma_2\lambda_2\cdots\gamma_{j-1}\lambda_{j-1} \right)
            \sum_{g=h}^j \left[\frac{e^{-\lambda_g t_C}}{\prod_{k=h, k\ne g}^j} (\lambda_k - \lambda_g) \right] \, \mbox{ for } 1 < j
\end{equation}
Here, $t_C$ [years] is the time that the UF spends in storage cooling,  $m_j(t_C)$ [kg] is the 
mass of the $j$\superscript{th} daughter of the parent species with mass $m_1$ [kg]. The $\lambda$s [1/years] 
are the decay constants for the respective nuclides in the decay chain.   The $\gamma$s are the branch ratios 
that correspond to each decay constant for this decay chain.  

Finally, these results are sent to the reprocessing model (where separation efficiencies are applied), output 
parameters are recorded, and (for the FR case) the next cycle starts.   





\section{Fuel Cycle Model Benchmarking \& Results}
\index{Fuel Cycle Model Benchmarking \& Results@\emph{Fuel Cycle Model Benchmarking \& Results}}
\label{1g_sec:fcmodel_benchmark}
The fuel cycle model is the computational wrapper that executes much of the calculation and analysis.  The fuel 
cycles that are studied are specified by a large set of inputs extending to the various intrinsic parameters of 
the reactors that comprise it.  For example, the $P_{NL}$ of different reactors are specific to the underlying
design and neutron transport characteristics.  Other parameters include the target burnup, the 
amount of time that UF spends in storage cooling, and the fuel cell specifications that are used.  Values 
for these parameters that were used in this study are presented in Table \ref{1g_table1}.  Knowing this information, the 
fuel cycle model wraps around the reactor burnup model and invokes it when input streams need to be mixed 
or spent fuel compositions must be found.  The fuel cycle model then sends the results of the burnup model 
to the next fuel cycle component (as seen in Figures \ref{1g_fig08} \& \ref{1g_fig09}).  Thus the fuel cycle 
model coupled with the burnup model developed here produce unique, physics-based values for the material 
balances for one or many recycle passes.  This represents an advantage over recipe based 
simulations which are not able to alter any of the input parameters at will.  In this model all inputs are 
allowed to change simeltaneously.

It is important to point out that the burnup model is sensitive to the input parameters specified in 
Table \ref{1g_table1}.  To select the non-leakage probability $P_{NL}$ and calibrate the model, 
enrichment and burnup combinations were taken from VISION \cite{Jacobson2009} libraries for LEU for a 3 batch core.  
By thinly varying $P_{NL}$ and the coolant density $\rho^C$ [g/cm\superscript{3}] and toggling the f-factor correlating 
cycle-average hydrogen cross sections with discharge burnup a wide range of enrichment values 
were generated.  These are presented in Table \ref{1g_table2} along with benchmark enrichment/burnup 
values taken from two other sources.  The parameter set H was eventually chosen for the actual 
model as it most closely represents reality and the VISION targets.  Note that the enrichment is in 
weight percent \nuc{U}{235} and BUd is in units of [MWd/kgIHM].  This calibration must be performed for 
each reactor system to be analyzed.

A series of benchmarks were carried out to verify both the fresh fuel composition and fuel burnup calculations.  
The OECD Burnup Credit Criticality Benchmark \cite{Takano1994} series is a composite of many international studies using 
independent, high fidelity neutronics codes acting on the same specifications.  The study selected for 
benchmarking, Phase I for PWRs, uses an initial fuel vector (3.6 w/o \nuc{U}{235} with trace amounts of 
\nuc{U}{234} and \nuc{U}{236}) that is burned to 40 MWd/kg.  The study lists output isotopics at various 
stages during the burn and post-removal cooling.  

To benchmark the burnup algorithm developed here, the initial fuel vector and burn parameters are taken 
from the study but ``generic'' PWR cross section sets were used.  In other words, the cross sections 
developed for a reference 17x17 PWR lattice were used with the burnup model and detailed transport 
calculations to create customized cross section sets for the benchmark case were not carried out.  
This situation reflects the procedure that might actually be carried in a fuel cycle scoping calculation, 
where it is desirable to treat all reactors of a single general type as represented by a generic archetype.  
Table \ref{1g_table3} compares the computed isotopics to the isotopic vector reported in the OECD study for 
a 40 MWd/kgIHM burn with no cooling.  The table also shows the standard deviation of the collected results 
for the 21 participants in the Phase-IB study.

All values are given in terms of weight percent of initial heavy metal.    These results show that 
the present method matches the Burnup Credit within two standard deviations for most actinides.  
The only species showing a much larger relative departure is \nuc{Am}{241}.  \nuc{Am}{241} is formed 
almost exclusively through \nuc{Pu}{241} decay and there are two reasons for this departure.  First, the 
fluence-dependent isotopic transformation matrices were assembled using a constant flux $4\times10^{14}$ 
[n/cm\superscript{2}/s] that is representative of most PWRs.  If the average flux and power density are somewhat lower, 
and hence the irradiation time is somewhat longer as is the case here, the model will under predict the 
\nuc{Am}{241} buildup in the core.   Second, the model does not explicitly treat refueling downtimes 
when transmutation ceases but decay continues. Note that the deviation in long-term \nuc{Am}{241} content 
is smaller because the concentration of the much more abundant parent, \nuc{Pu}{241}, is reasonably accurate. 

It is also necessary to benchmark the feed stream blending and discharge burnup calculations.  This is best 
achieved in the context of a comparitive fuel cycle material balance.  Material balances of this type 
generated using the high-fidelity material balance simulation package COSI \cite{Boucher2006} are 
available in a number 
of OECD systems studies \cite{OECD2002}.  A benchmark of the equilibrium material balance for a PWR/FR fleet 
has been carried out.  In this benchmark, the methodology described here is used to find the enrichment 
of PWR fuel to achieve a specified burnup as well as to derive the equilibrium FR fresh and spent fuel 
compositions through the cycle iteration procedure described above.  Specific results benchmarked 
included the PWR/FR thermal power split, the isotopic composition of the burned fuel, and the fuel cycle 
cost derived from the material balance flowsheets.  





\subsection{The Recyclable Uranium Fuel Cycle}
\index{The Recyclable Uranium Fuel Cycle@\emph{The Recyclable Uranium Fuel Cycle}}
\label{1g_sec:RUFC}
The RU fuel cycle described does not preclude multi-recycle of transuranics.  Instead it 
focuses only upon the uranium component of an integrated recycle strategy.  Moreover, for 
purposes of illustration only the first uranium recycle pass is considered.  A second example 
applying the burnup model to a dynamic case will be covered in the FR fuel cycle section.

To further characterize what is happening in the burnup model, it is of interest to characterize 
the isotopic breakdown of the neutron production and destruction rates in the core.  To do so, one 
simple case is considered.

For this illustrative case the \nuc{U}{235} enrichment is chosen at 4.0\%, while the \nuc{U}{236} 
enrichment is set to 1.5\%.  Three batch fuel management is assumed and a graph of $\mbox{BU}(F)$ 
is made in analogy to Figure \ref{1g_fig05}.  The discharge burnup BUd of this fuel is not known 
\emph{a priori} but it is instead calculated via the burnup model that was described above.  
BUd was calculated to be approximately 37 MWd/kgIHM.  Figures \ref{1g_fig10}-\ref{1g_fig13} show the 
computed core-average neutron production and destruction rates for burnups of 0, 1/3 BUd, 2/3 BUd, and BUd.  
Zero burnup here indicates the neutron production and destruction rates for fresh fuel that has just been 
loaded into the reactor.  

It is crucial to note that the production and destruction rates of the species shown in these 
figures reflect the isotope and all of its daughters.  For example, by the end of life, most of 
the neutrons are coming from \nuc{U}{238} and its daughters.  In fact very few neutrons are spawned from 
\nuc{U}{238} itself, but rather from its daughter \nuc{Pu}{239}.  Similarly, by the time the fuel has 
reached BUd much of the \nuc{U}{235} has already burned off.  These figures show that the neutron 
balance is well represented by a mass-weighted linear combination of initial isotopics; therefore 
the fluence dependent balance depends strongly on initial composition of the fuel.  To scope the 
merit of RU blending strategies, It has been found to be useful to parameterize discharge burnups 
of RU-bearing fuels around this dependence.

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig13.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To accomplish this the achievable burnup is parameterized as a function of the fresh fuel initial \nuc{U}{235} 
content, initial \nuc{U}{236} content, and the number of batches in the fuel management scheme.    Note that 
given this small number of degrees of freedom, the whole parameter space may be comprehensively mapped.  
Therefore the discharge burnup can be found as a function of these three variables 
(\nuc{U}{235}\%, \nuc{U}{236}\%, $B$).  With the FRs, finding such a parameterization would be bulky and 
unwieldy if even computable.  Moreover, it would be prohibitive to try to do so for FRs since the parameter 
space of initial isotopes is larger by at least an order of magnitude.  

The functional form of the equation that gives BUd is shown in equation \ref{1g_BUd_fit}.  In this equation, 
BUd is the discharge burnup achievable [MWd/kgIHM], $x$ is the weight percent of \nuc{U}{235} in the fresh 
fuel [(w/o)IHM], $y$ is the weight percent of \nuc{U}{236} in the fresh fuel [(w/o)IHM], and $B$ is the 
number of batches.  All other letters appearing in equation \ref{1g_BUd_fit} are parameters of the fit 
and have units appropriate to their placement.  The values of these parameters that were obtained for 
the data set generated are given in Table \ref{1g_table4}.
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_BUd_fit}
\mbox{BUd}(x, y, B) = \frac{2B}{B+1}\cdot \left(j(x-h)^m + s\cdot y + t \cdot x + k\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Parametric Values for Burnup Model Fit for RU Burning LWRs}
\label{1g_table4}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
\hline
$j$ & 17.5 \\
$h$ & 2.0 \\
$m$ & 0.7 \\
$s$ & -2.5 \\
$t$ & -1.75 \\
$k$ & 8.2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In equation \ref{1g_BUd_fit}, fit parameters and the dependent variables are based on 
physical meanings.  First, the $2B/(B+1)$ dependence of BUd comes directly from the results of a 
linear reactivity model with the core burnup being an independent variable when calculating the 
reactivity.  The proof of this dependence and its physicality are given in \cite{Driscoll1990}. Moreover, the 
$j(x-h)m$ term comes from the fact that the major trend for burnup follows a power law. One 
expects that the burnup would, as a function of fluence, asymptotically approach the maximum 
possible burnup (931.46 MWd/kgIHM).  However, the power law, with $m<1$, seen here is a good 
approximation for the relatively low burnups achieved in PWRs.  $j$ scales this term up to 
the valid burnup range and $h$ slides the burnup over to the \nuc{U}{235} enrichment under 
which burning is not feasible.

Furthermore, at a given \nuc{U}{235} enrichment, BUd is seen to have a near-linear dependence upon 
\nuc{U}{236} content.  Because the \nuc{U}{236} is a poison and is present in relatively small amounts, 
incremental changes in its enrichment yield matching changes in the burnup.  More explicitly, 
$s$ determines how much a given \nuc{U}{236} content affects the burnup.  Additionally, $s$ is negative 
because \nuc{U}{236} only destroys neutrons and does not directly increase the energy gained from the 
fuel per atom IHM.  However, BUd also decreases linearly with the \nuc{U}{235} content.  The $tx$ term 
is a correction factor to the power law term.  It slightly weights lower \nuc{U}{235} enrichments 
preferentially to higher burnups.  This term exists because there is \nuc{U}{236} present.  This term 
captures the poisoning effect of \nuc{U}{236}; with increased \nuc{U}{236} more \nuc{U}{235} is needed 
to achieve a given burnup.  Lastly, the constant $k$ term scales up the burnup to the appropriate base value.

Thus equation \ref{1g_BUd_fit} satisfies the requirements of fitting the maximum discharge burnup data to 
\nuc{U}{235} content, \nuc{U}{236} content, and the total number of batches while having a physical 
interpretation.  

Figures \ref{1g_fig14} \& \ref{1g_fig15} show how the closed form equation with the given parameters 
fits to the actual data that was generated for three and six batch cores respectively.  These figures 
show that the fit with the data is quite good for \nuc{U}{235} enrichments between 2 - 6\% and 
\nuc{U}{236} content from 0 - 4.5\%.   Having such a fit equation is useful as it allows for the near 
instant calculation of the burnup for a PWR bearing RU fuel.  

There is a large advantage to this with respect to the RU fuel cycle.  Recall that the fuel cycle model 
mixes an RU stream from LWR UF and an enriched NU stream.  Thus using Equation 19, the maximum achievable 
burnup of the mixed fuel can be found with ease and without resorting to a lengthy calculation or 
resubmitting the relevant data to the burnup model.  Moreover, given the \nuc{U}{236} enrichment, the number 
of batches, and a target burnup, the fit equation can then be easily iterated to find the \nuc{U}{235} enrichment 
required.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{Burnup Model Fit with Data for 3 Batch Core for LWRs}
\label{1g_fig14}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig14.eps}

\label{1g_fig15}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig15.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{1g_fig16} the \nuc{U}{236} is held at a constant 1\% while the number of batches is 
allowed to vary.  Note that in all three of these figures the low burnups do not fit as well to 
equation \ref{1g_BUd_fit}. However, this region of discharge burnups of less than 20 MWd/kgIHM is 
of low concern for PWRs.   Moreover, as a function of batch number Equation 19 fits very well to 
all cases save the unlikely single batch case.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{Burnup Model Fit with Data for 1\% \nuc{U}{236} for LWRs}
\label{1g_fig16}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig16.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Lastly, fuel cycle material balances may be expediently generated.   As an example case, set the 
target burnups of the RU- and NU-burning reactors to 51 MWd/kgIHM.  As discussed above, either the 
relative mass of RU/LEU or the LEU enrichment may be the free variable.  Allowing the LEU enrichment 
to be free and the mass of RU and LEU to be blended is the same,  Figure \ref{1g_fig17} shows the mass balance of 
the fuel cycle just defined and it can be seen that the LEU enrichment needed to obtain the 
target burnup for the blended fuel is 8.5\%.  Note that this figure is in analogy to Figure \ref{1g_fig08}, 
but with mass stream values included.  Moreover, Figure \ref{1g_fig17} is normalized to 1 kgIHM in the RU reactor.

\subsection{The Fast Reactor Fuel Cycle}
\index{The Fast Reactor Fuel Cycle@\emph{The Fast Reactor Fuel Cycle}}
\label{1g_sec:FRFC}
A walkthrough follows of how to apply the burnup model algorithm to the closed fast reactor 
system described above.  The first time a fast reactor system comes online, there exists no 
FR-U and FR-TRU streams from prior cycles so these mass flows and compositions are set to zero.   
This leaves only reprocessed DU and LWR-TRU streams to be mixed in order to obtain the burnup 
value specified for the fast reactor.  These two parameters reduce to only one 
variable since DU = 1 - LWR-TRU.  Therefore the system has only one degree of freedom.  

It should be noted here that the DU and LWR-TRU internal isotopic compositions remain constant 
over all fuel cycle passes through the fast reactor.  This is because the LWR burnup remains the 
same and identical LWR UF is always used to top up the fast reactor.  

To obtain the DU/LWR-TRU ratio that achieves the target burnup, an initial guess of the ratio 
is made.  This resulting fuel is then sent to the burnup model and maximum discharge burnup is 
calculated.  A root finding method is then used to iterate over the ratio and BUd until a 
proportion of DU/LWR-TRU is found that generates the target burnup.  The bisection method 
is once again applied due to its usefulness with regards to pointwise approximations of continuous data.

Two initial conditions are first calculated for the bisection method to be used.  
Firstly, a BUd is calculated (via the burnup model) for a fuel that is composed of entirely LWR-TRU.  
If this is not a valid fuel form (as discussed above) then an incremental amount of DU is added 
until a valid, burnable form is reached.  The second initial condition is just the inverse.  A BUd 
is found for a fuel that is primarily or all DU.  These two conditions serve to bound the range 
of available burnups for the FR fresh fuel.  If the FR target burnup is outside of this range, then 
the remainder of the calculation is impossible.  Otherwise, the bisection method may be applied with 
these two starting conditions.  Upon reaching the target burnup, the amount of DU and LWR-TRU that 
go into the fast reactor on the first pass of the FR fuel cycle is now known.

The isotopic output of this first fast reactor burn is then sent to the cooling model.   After the FR 
UF has been decayed for the appropriate amount of time the reprocessing separation efficiencies are 
applied.  These separation efficiencies are set initially and are constant for the entire fuel cycle, 
although they may vary between individual chemical elements.  Fuel cycle parameters are now calculated 
and recorded.  This concludes the first cycle pass through the fast reactor.  

The second and further passes proceed similarly to the first.  However unlike in the first pass, the 
four mass streams (DU, LWR-TRU, FR-U, and FR-TRU) now all exist as the FR-TRU and U discharged from 
the fast burner will be reloaded in the next cycle.  However, FRs convert 15-20\% of their initial 
actinide mass into fission products over the course of their burn and considerable top-up from DU 
and LWR-TRU will be required.  

However, the same problem remains as in the first pass case; the DU/LWR-TRU proportion 
that generates a burnup that equals the target burnup is not known \emph{a priori}.  Thus the same strategy 
that was used in the first cycle is employed to find this proportion.  Once again, two guesses are 
made as to what the stream's relative fractions are.  These bound the burnups available and the 
bisection method is applied to calculate the DU/LWR-TRU ratio that hits the target burnup.  

Now that the target burnup has been reached and the fresh fuel burned, it becomes spent fuel once 
more.  The FR UF is again stored and cooled.  These results are then sent to the reprocessing code 
where the separation efficiencies are applied.  Fuel cycle parameters that are specific to this 
pass are now calculated and stored.

This process may continue indefinitely as there are an infinite number of cycles possible.  However, 
fuel cycle parameters (such as isotopic concentrations in the fresh and spent fuels, uranium and 
transuranic masses) typically come to ``equilibrium'' given enough passes through the system.  
Two approaches to determining equilibrium status were considered: the stabilization of certain 
tracked isotopes or the convergence of the FR fresh fuel transuranic fraction.   This TRU fraction 
is tracked until it converges to within error, say a 1\% change between the last cycle and the 
next-to-last cycle at which time equilibrium is declared.    The advantage of this method is that, 
for all practical applications, it ensures that the four input mass streams have all converged on 
their own and the mass balance is in near-equilibrium.  

If the fuel cycle study is concerned with the prevalence of isotopes having, for instance, a strong 
effect on repository performance it is wiser to develop a list of important species whose convergence 
is to be tracked.  Then at the start of each cycle after the first, the change of these isotopes 
concentrations in the spent fuel is calculated.  If all isotopes in the list have converged to 
within some allotted error (perhaps 1\%), then the fuel cycle as a whole is said to have converged.   
In the FR case considered here, \nuc{Pu}{239}, \nuc{Pu}{240}, and \nuc{Pu}{242} dominate the TRU by 
mass and converge after only a few cycles.    Moreover, \nuc{Pu}{242} is the precursor isotope for 
production of most of the trans-plutonium elements.    Even though other actinides affect the FR 
burnup, many either do so to a lesser degree or are present in such small amounts that they do 
not significantly impact the neutronics of the system.  However depending on the application 
being studied the convergence criteria may differ.  For instance, the radiologically significant 
isotope \nuc{Cm}{244} still has not converged by the above definition, even after ten cycles.

Now that the entirety of the fuel cycle over multiple passes has been computed via the prior 
algorithm, a number of cycle specific parameters may be calculated.  The following example data 
was all produced using LWR UF isotopic vectors from VISION \cite{Jacobson2009}. Moreover the following table 
displays initial parameters input into the computational burnup and fuel cycle models.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{FR Input Mass Stream Fractions of 1 kgIHM}
\label{1g_fig18}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig18.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The first set of parameters displayed is the input fractions of the four input mass streams 
into the fast reactor: DU, LWR-TRU, FR-U, and FR-TRU.  This is shown in Figure \ref{1g_fig18}.  
The input mass of fuel into the fast reactor comes in some part from LWR spent fuel (1 kg or less) 
and partially from recycled FR fuel.  Note that all streams are normalized to 1 kgIHM for each cycle.  
The LWR streams here are the parameters that are explicitly iterated over in the fuel cycle model 
in order to achieve the target FR burnup.  Note that the first cycle is comprised of only LWR 
spent fuel (as discussed above) and then these curves quickly level off.    Also recall that 
all FR actinide mass (sans what is decayed away in storage and what is lost in reprocessing) 
returns to the FR on the next pass.  Since the FR converts roughly 20\% of its initial fuel to 
fission products, this explains why the sum of FR-U and FR-TRU levels off at about 0.8.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{FR-U and FR-TRU Output Fractions}
\label{1g_fig19}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig19.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Unlike the LWRs, the fast reactor output stream is also a function of cycle number.  
Figure \ref{1g_fig19} plots the fraction of the uranium and transuranic relative to 
the total actinide content of the output stream.   The parameters calculated here are 
the by-products of applying the burnup model to the fast reactor fresh fuel that was formed above.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{TRU Conversion Ratio}
\label{1g_fig20}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig20.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

There are various ways to define a reactor's conversion ratio.  One of these is displayed in Figure 
\ref{1g_fig20}.  Specifically, this is known as the transuranic conversion ratio (TruCR).  
This is defined as the change in the mass of TRU in the fast reactor core divided by the 
discharge burnup (BUd) of the core divided by the maximum possible burnup.  Symbolically, 
\begin{equation}
\label{1g_tru_cr}
\mbox{TruCR} = 1 - \frac{\mbox{TRU}_{\mbox{in}} - \mbox{TRU}_{\mbox{out}}}{\frac{\mbox{BUd}}{\mbox{BU}_{\mbox{max}}}}
             = 1 - \frac{\mbox{TRU}_{\mbox{in}} - \mbox{TRU}_{\mbox{out}}}{\frac{\mbox{BUd}}{931.46 \mbox{MWd/kg}}}
\end{equation}
TRU\subscript{in} is defined as the sum of the LWR-TRU and FR-TRU streams as plotted in 
Figure \ref{1g_fig16}.  TRU\subscript{out} is simply the mass of TRU in the output stream, 
or the FR-TRU fraction in Figure \ref{1g_fig19} multiplied by the actinide mass in output (~80\%).  
It should be noted that this is one of the possible ways to determine equilibrium.  
Waiting for the TruCR to converge is equivalent to waiting for the fast reactor fresh fuel 
uranium divided by the transuranic content to stabilize.  More importantly, this curve does 
seem to equilibrate as a function of cycle number.  Furthermore, the data is in the range of 0.5, 
which was the conversion ratio targeted for the fast reactor point design used by the burnup model. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\caption{Mass of LWR UF Required for FR Fresh Fuel Top-Up}
\label{1g_fig21}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{one_group_method/figs/Fig21.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{1g_fig21} shows the mass in kilograms of LWR UF that is required to generate 
the 1 kg of fuel that goes into the fast reactor. The first point will naturally be 
significantly higher than for subsequent cycle numbers.  This is because the first cycle 
is made entirely of recycled LWR fuel whereas other cycles use LWR Uo
F only as top up.

Finally, individual graphs may be generated for every isotope that is tracked.  
The plots display the total mass of the given isotope in both the fresh (input) and spent (output) 
fast reactor fuel streams.  Note that the output masses are given after the additional cooling time.  
Samples for \nuc{Pu}{238}, \nuc{Pu}{239}, \nuc{Pu}{240}, \nuc{Cm}{244}, and \nuc{Cm}{244} are shown 
in Figures \ref{1g_fig22}-\ref{1g_fig26} respectively.  The plutonium figures serve to show that the 
system does appear to settle at an equilibrium state within the ten cycles considered here.  
However, the difference in the curvature of the \nuc{Pu}{239} graph to that of the \nuc{Pu}{238} and 
\nuc{Pu}{240} implies that the \nuc{Pu}{239} is being burned out while the other two nuclides are 
being bred in.  Moreover, the \nuc{Cm}{244} and \nuc{Cm}{246} figures are examples of species that 
do not come to equilibrium after the given number of cycles.  These nuclides are still being bred in 
via a long chain of parent species.  

Lastly, a numerical demonstration of this is shown in Table \ref{1g_table5}.  This displays the 
input concentrations [kg/kgIHM] of selected actinides in the fresh fuel.  The output values are 
after burning and cooling, as with the figures above.  Data is shown here for three fuel cycle 
pass numbers: 1, 3, and 10.  It is clear that convergence to equilibrium must be explicitly 
modeled as it will extend over many decades.

\section{Conclusions}
\index{Conclusions@\emph{Conclusions}}
\label{1g_sec:conclusions}
Given the proper the input libraries, this burnup model may be applied to nearly any 
reactor in any fuel cycle system.  Moreover, the computational 
requirements are very light, with complete 
non-equilibrium fuel cycle material balances being generated in a few seconds.   

The quickness of these burnup calculations allows for larger fuel cycle problems to be 
more accurately studied.  Many of the variables set as static in this model may 
serve as future parameterizations.  Iterating these may yield optimum values for various fuel 
cycle metrics.  For example, the separation efficiencies and partitioning strategies may be 
changed in the FR case.  This would have a significant impact on the FR-TRU stream if 
reprocessing efficiencies were not the same for all elements.  This would not 
only alter the fresh fuel that the FR received, but repository performance and proliferation 
resistance would be affected as well.  

In fact it is the very speed of the burnup model that allows the for the closed form equation 
that was derived for LWR performance.  Calculating the hundreds of data points that went into 
solving for equation \ref{1g_BUd_fit} would require a prohibitive amount of time using a full 
core transport or Monte Carlo method.  Furthermore, fuel cycle studies associated with the 
uranium recycle strategy could not be carried out in any meaningful sense in the absence of 
this kind of parameterization.

Still, this study only displayed the applicability of the burnup model to two fuel cycles.  
While this is important since it demonstrates that it is a useful tool for both open and 
closed cycles, many reactor types are available other than nominal LWRs and FRs.  Furthermore, 
the number of fuel cycles associated with combinations of these reactors is very large.  
As discussed in \S \ref{1g_sec:gen_BU_param}, pre-computation via transport calculations of a 
representative set of cross section libraries will be necessary for each new coolant and fuel 
type that is to be studied.  The representative set would span the spectral conditions to be 
expected in the reactor and would be interpolated on initial isotopics and discharge burnup 
as is already being done for the UOX fueled PWRs.

Moreover, this method is best applied to systems where spectra do not shift significantly during 
irradiation.  For reactors and fuels that have neutron energy distributions that change more 
significantly with burnup than a standard UOX fueled LWR, or for cases where the energy spectrum 
depends strongly on initial isotopics but the model needs to handle a wide variety of initial 
isotopic permutations, this new method will lose effectiveness.  Mixed-oxide and very 
high burnup Inert Matrix Fuel (IMF), for example, would not be suitable for both of these reasons.  
Both evince strongly burnup dependent per-atom reaction rates for some species, 
\emph{e.g.} \nuc{Pu}{240}, because of evolving energy and spatial self-shielding effects.  
Combined with the many degrees of freedom in the initial compositions of these fuels 
(\emph{i.e.} plutonium and minor actinide isotopics in the fresh fuels) that may be of interest 
in fuel cycle studies, an impractically large number of pre-computed cross section libraries 
would need to be prepared for use with the method presented here.  Hence, \S \ref{mg_paper} will extend 
this algorithm to a multi-group format so as to be able to treat these spectral effects at a higher 
level of fidelity using a reasonable number of pre-computed libraries.
